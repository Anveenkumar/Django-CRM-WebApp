1. **Clone the Repository**: First, you need to clone the repository from GitHub. You can do this with the following command in your terminal: git clone <your-repository-url>
(Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository)
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**: To create a virtual environment for your Python projects to isolate the dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using the following command: python3 -m venv env
(This will create a new virtual environment named `env`.)
3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Before installing the dependencies, you need to activate the virtual environment. On macOS and Linux, you can do this with:( for linux )source env/bin/activate,( for windows ) .\env\Scripts\activate
4. **Install Dependencies**: Using  `requirements.txt` file in the repository, you can install all the dependencies with: pip install -r requirements.txt
5. **Run Migrations**: Django uses migrations to apply changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema. You can apply migrations using the following command: python manage.py migrate
6. **Run the Server**: Finally, you can start the Django development server with:python manage.py runserver
7. You should now be able to access your application at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
